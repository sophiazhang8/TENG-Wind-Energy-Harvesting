# TENG-Wind-Energy-Harvesting
As global temperatures broke records within the past decade due to climate change, using Earthâ€™s renewable natural resources has becoming increasingly more essential. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) can convert different types of mechanical movements into usable energy by using 2 oppositely charged materials. In this project, I used different methods to maximize renewable energy harvesting from wind at low speeds (as low as 12km/h). This includes the use of proper triboelectric materials, prototype design and parameter optimizations, and signal processing of the electrical output. The compact and effective TENG built can ensure that everyday breeze will no longer be wasted.
